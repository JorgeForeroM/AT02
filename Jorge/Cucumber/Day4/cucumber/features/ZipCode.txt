You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^I have a zipCode e(\d+)$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Given(/^UserName jorgebrian(\d+)$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Given(/^Country Bolivia(\d+)$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
